# thatsmyhorseduck
That's My Horse is a game where you shove your friend and protest "that's my horse!" as if in some sort of unexpected equine altercation. This microgame allows you to experience the magic of playing That's My Horse with a rubber duck in an infinite void. He is very passionate about That's My Horse and appreciates the opportunity.
