# thatsmyhorseduck
That's My Horse is a game where you shove your friend and protest "that's my horse!" as if in some sort of unexpected equine altercation. This microgame allows you to experience the magic of playing That's My Horse with a rubber duck in an infinite void. He is very passionate about That's My Horse and appreciates the opportunity.

Playable executables can be found in build - Windows users can just download and unzip the zipped folder, run the horseduck.exe file, and shove away! Linux and Mac users may need to copy the .bam and .png files, along with the tex folder, into the directory the executable is in (labelled with your OS). 

The camera is controlled with the mouse. There are three offensive and one affectionate moves, controlled by keyboard buttons.
